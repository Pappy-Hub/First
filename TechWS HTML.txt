                    development. However,
                    within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master the
                    soft
                    skills
                    required for being a software developer.

                    So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software
                    developer.

                    immense learning that was really different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
                    fun
                    and there were some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig
                    immediately after the program.

                    Thank you Studio for that push I needed.

                    <p><b>Why Is This Course Relevant Today? </b></p>
                    There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there is a consistent
                    demand for developers who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can
                    design
                    creative solutions. <br><br>

                    You'll also be introduced to the concepts of Responsive Design - targeting different screen sizes
                    and
                    working with frameworks such as Bootstrap <br><br>

                    <p><b> What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of The Course?</b></p>
                    By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming
                    language – JavaScript. You’ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and
                    have experience working with a team in a development environment. <br><br>


                    You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. You’ll have gained
                    foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development – managing complex data sets,
                    securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to
                    prepare them to scale. <br><br>


                    <p><b>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</b></p>
                    Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at
                    least 350GB. The course will walk you through installing the necessary free software. <br><br>

                    At least, you’ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous programming language
                    experience is required.<br><br>

                    <p><b>What Can I Expect To Accomplish By The End Of This Program?</b></p>
                    You'll understand the client/server roles in handling HTTP requests and thereafter move to advanced
                    concepts used to populate dynamic data to projects. <br> <br>

                    By the end of this course, you’d have: <br> <br>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Completed several individual and group projects</li><br>
                        <li>Learned about web development from experienced web developers</li><br>
                        <li>Networked with some of the best developers, companies, and entrepreneurs in Lagos</li><br>
                        <li>Prepared yourself with the foundational knowledge you need to begin a career that
                            embraces continuous learning</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><b>What Does Success In This Program Look Like?</b></p>

                    To get the most out of this course, you have to be willing to fully immerse yourself (get it?) in
                    the classroom environment. This means actively engaging with your instructors, classmates, and
                    career coach, as well as taking every opportunity to apply your new skills toward real-life
                    projects. <br><br>

                    We’ll help guide you through the entire process, but in order to succeed you’ll need to completely
                    commit to your work and continuously push yourself. <br><br>
